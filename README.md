# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-Show-Appointment

No Appointment Medical Attendance Analysis
This repository contains a Python project that investigates a dataset of medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on the characteristics of patients and their attendance or absence from scheduled appointments. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing patient attendance at medical appointments.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset of medical appointments and explore the relationships between various variables and patient attendance. The project consists of the following components:

1. Data Wrangling: In this stage, the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies are addressed to ensure the accuracy of the findings.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: The exploratory data analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. Key questions are investigated, including the ratio of patient attendance, the impact of waiting time on attendance, the effect of age and gender on attendance, and the influence of scholarships and SMS reminders.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
NoAppointmentMedicalAttendance/

 ```
  ├── data/
  │   ├── medical_appointments.csv
  │   ├── cleaned_medical_appointments.csv
  │   
  ├── notebooks/
  │   ├── exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
  │   ├── data_wrangling.ipynb
  │   └── ...
  ├── README.md
  └── .gitignore

```

The data/ directory will store the original and cleaned dataset in CSV format. The initial dataset is provided as medical_appointments.csv, and the cleaned dataset will be saved as cleaned_medical_appointments.csv.

The notebooks/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and data wrangling. The exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb notebook contains the code and analysis for exploring the dataset, and the data_wrangling.ipynb notebook shows the steps taken to clean and prepare the data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NoAppointmentMedicalAttendance.git

2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable)

3. Explore the data/ directory to find the original dataset (medical_appointments.csv).

4. Open the notebooks/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb notebook to view the analysis of the dataset and the key findings.

5. Open the notebooks/data_wrangling.ipynb notebook to see how the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.

## Data Files
- medical_appointments.csv: The original dataset containing information about 110,000 medical appointments.

- cleaned_medical_appointments.csv: The cleaned and prepared dataset used for the exploratory data analysis.
